# CRPS2 Exoskeletons by MRI @ TUM
Hey there! This is the repository for all published files for our on-going exoskeleton project. We peridically upload our findings as well as the CAD files and firmware files once they are published, so that anyone interested in it can build an example for themselves.  Feel welcome to download and adapt the designs. We are always looking for opportunities to cooperate in this project, so do not hesitate to reach out to us, if you are interested in this research!

The aim of this research is to develop a system that patients can wear and use at home to exercise and regain their range of motion. This would allow trained professionals to supervise for patients at once with less effort involved, reducing the strain on our current therapy system. While we picked CRPS as our target ailment, the systems are viable for all afflictions that reduce the range of motion of the fingers.
